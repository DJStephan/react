# react-assessment
This assessment serves as the capstone of the interpersonal and technical lecture modules by combining a presentation combining the "Tell Your Story" module and the React/Redux, front-end development, module. Students will be given both weeks of the React module to design and develop a personal portfolio page. This portfolio page will contain their biographies, stories (Maybe in a blog format), resumes, descriptions of the assignments and assessments they completed, any previous projects they built, and professional images of themselves. The students should develop their own user stories and design the portfolio site themselves. On assessment day, students will take a short Anki assessment over terms from the React module and then each student will present their portfolio pages along with their stories and experiences through FastTrack'D to the class and any internal Cook employees that wish to come and watch.
